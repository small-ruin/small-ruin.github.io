挑衅

你擅长引诱敌人攻击你

需求：魅力13，bab+1

好处：当一个智力为3以上的敌人能看到你，能听到你的声音，且你正处于他的威胁范围时，你可以用一个移动动作对其挑衅（这是一个影响心灵效果）。当被挑衅的敌人开始他的回合时，如果你仍然在他的威胁范围，且与你之间有效果线，他必须进行一次意志豁免(DC 10+你的人物等级的一半+你的魅力调整值)。如果豁免失败，那么这回合他进行近战攻击的对象只能是你。（如果将你击杀，使你昏迷，失去你的视野，或者无法对你进行近战攻击，他可以如常对其他人进行剩余的近战攻击。）被挑衅的对手依然可以入常施法，进行远程攻击，移动，或者进行其他动作。该专长只限制近战攻击。

特殊：战士可选择挑衅作为奖励专长。

> As a move action, you may goad an opponent that threatens you, has line of sight to you, can hear you, and has an Intelligence of 3 or higher. (The goad is a > mind-affecting effect.) When the goaded opponent starts its next turn, if it threatens you and has line of sight to you, it must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 > your character level + your Cha modifier). If the opponent fails its save, you are the only creature it can make melee attacks against during this turn. (If it kills you, > knocks you unconscious, loses sight of you, or otherwise is unable to make melee attacks against you, it may make any remaining melee attacks against other foes, as > normal.) A goaded creature may still cast spells, make ranged attacks, move, or perform other actions normally. The use of this feat restricts only melee attacks.

> **Special**
> A fighter may select Goad as one of his fighter bonus feats.
